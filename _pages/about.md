Iâ€™m a PhD graduate from the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Cincinnati, and I performed research in the [Biomedical Acoustics Laboratory](https://ceas.uc.edu/research/centers-labs/biomedical-acoustics-laboratory.html) under the guidance of Dr. T. Douglas Mast. My research interests include ultrasound imaging, speech production, and machine learning. I am particularly interested in improvements to the accessibility of ultrasound imaging, the interdisciplinary application of biomedical technologies to speech science, and the use of speech for healthcare (e.g., speech biomarkers, speech therapy). I was awarded an [NIH F31 fellowship](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10537976) for my dissertation research on expanding the interpretation of tongue ultrasound images during speech production.
